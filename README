elfhacks a.k.a. examples (copyrights & info in header of each C source file)

NOTE: You are going to need to have library installed in your path else
compilation will fail.

https://github.com/nullkey/elfhacks.git

Usage:
make
	compiles c sources and places respective 32,64bit libs into 32,64
	folders

make install
	installs 32/64 bit versions of compiled shared objects (.so's) into
	/usr/local/$LIB (assumes lib64/lib32 exists in your tree, if this is
	not the case, modify appropriate makefiles).


To actually use your libraries under Linux export LD_PRELOAD env variable.

Example:

LD_PRELOAD=fps.so glxgears
